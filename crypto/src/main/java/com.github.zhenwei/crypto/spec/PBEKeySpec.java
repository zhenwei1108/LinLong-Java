/**
 * A user-chosen password that can be used with password-based encryption (PBE).
 * <p>
 * The password can be viewed as some kind of raw key material, from which the
 * encryption mechanism that uses it derives a cryptographic key.
 * <p>
 * Different PBE mechanisms may consume different bits of each password
 * character. For example, the PBE mechanism defined in PKCS #5 looks at only
 * the low order 8 bits of each character, whereas PKCS #12 looks at all 16 bits
 * of each character.
 * <p>
 * You convert the password characters to a PBE key by creating an instance of
 * the appropriate secret-key factory. For example, a secret-key factory for
 * PKCS #5 will construct a PBE key from only the low order 8 bits of each
 * password character, whereas a secret-key factory for PKCS #12 will take all
 * 16 bits of each character.
 * <p>
 * Also note that this class stores passwords as char arrays instead of String
 * objects (which would seem more logical), because the String class is
 * immutable and there is no way to overwrite its internal value when the
 * password stored in it is no longer needed. Hence, this class requests the
 * password as a char array, so it can be overwritten when done.
