/**
 * This class defines the <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)
 * for the <code>KeyAgreement</code> class.
 * All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each 
 * cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 * of a particular key agreement algorithm.
 * <p>
 * The keys involved in establishing a shared secret are created by one of the
 * key generators (<code>KeyPairGenerator</code> or <code>KeyGenerator</code>),
 * a <code>KeyFactory</code>, or as a result from an intermediate phase of the key
 * agreement protocol (see <a href = "#engineDoPhase(java.security.Key, boolean)">engineDoPhase</a>).
 * <p>
 * For each of the correspondents in the key exchange, <code>engineDoPhase</code>
 * needs to be called. For example, if the key exchange is with one other
 * party, <code>engineDoPhase</code> needs to be called once, with the
 * <code>lastPhase</code> flag set to <code>true</code>.
 * If the key exchange is with two other parties, <code>engineDoPhase</code> needs to be called twice,
 * the first time setting the <code>lastPhase</code> flag to
 * <code>false</code>, and the second time setting it to <code>true</code>.
 * There may be any number of parties involved in a key exchange.
