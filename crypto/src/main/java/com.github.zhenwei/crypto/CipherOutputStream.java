/**
 * A CipherOutputStream is composed of an OutputStream and a Cipher so
 * that write() methods first process the data before writing them out
 * to the underlying OutputStream.  The cipher must be fully
 * initialized before being used by a CipherOutputStream.
 * <p>
 * For example, if the cipher is initialized for encryption, the
 * CipherOutputStream will attempt to encrypt data before writing out the
 * encrypted data.
 * <p>
 * This class adheres strictly to the semantics, especially the
 * failure semantics, of its ancestor classes
 * java.io.OutputStream and java.io.FilterOutputStream.  This class
 * has exactly those methods specified in its ancestor classes, and
 * overrides them all.  Moreover, this class catches all exceptions
 * that are not thrown by its ancestor classes.
 * <p>
 * It is crucial for a programmer using this class not to use
 * methods that are not defined or overriden in this class (such as a
 * new method or constructor that is later added to one of the super
 * classes), because the design and implementation of those methods
 * are unlikely to have considered security impact with regard to
 * CipherOutputStream.
