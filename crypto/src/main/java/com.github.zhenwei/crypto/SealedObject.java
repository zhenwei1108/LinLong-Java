/**
 * This class enables a programmer to create an object and protect its
 * confidentiality with a cryptographic algorithm.
 *
 * <p>
 * Given any Serializable object, one can create a SealedObject
 * that encapsulates the original object, in serialized
 * format (i.e., a "deep copy"), and seals (encrypts) its serialized contents,
 * using a cryptographic algorithm such as DES, to protect its
 * confidentiality.  The encrypted content can later be decrypted (with
 * the corresponding algorithm using the correct decryption key) and
 * de-serialized, yielding the original object.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the Cipher object must be fully initialized with the
 * correct algorithm, key, padding scheme, etc., before being applied
 * to a SealedObject.
 *
 * <p>
 * The original object that was sealed can be recovered in two different
 * ways:
 * <p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>by using the <a href="#getObject(javax.crypto.Cipher)">getObject</a>
 * method that takes a <code>Cipher</code> object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This method requires a fully initialized <code>Cipher</code> object,
 * initialized with the
 * exact same algorithm, key, padding scheme, etc., that were used to seal the
 * object.
 *
 * <p>
 * This approach has the advantage that the party who unseals the
 * sealed object does not require knowledge of the decryption key. For example,
 * after one party has initialized the cipher object with the required
 * decryption key, it could hand over the cipher object to
 * another party who then unseals the sealed object.
 *
 * <p>
 * 
 * <li>by using one of the
 * <a href="#getObject(java.security.Key)">getObject</a> methods
 * that take a <code>Key</code> object.
 *
 * <p> In this approach, the <code>getObject</code> method creates a cipher
 * object for the appropriate decryption algorithm and initializes it with the
 * given decryption key and the algorithm parameters (if any) that were stored
 * in the sealed object.
 *
 * <p> This approach has the advantage that the party who
 * unseals the object does not need to keep track of the parameters (e.g., an
 * IV) that were used to seal the object.
 *
 * </ul>
