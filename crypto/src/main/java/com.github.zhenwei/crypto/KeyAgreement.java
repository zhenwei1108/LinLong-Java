/**
 * This class provides the functionality of a key agreement (or key
 * exchange) protocol.
 * The keys involved in establishing a shared secret are created by one of the
 * key generators (<code>KeyPairGenerator</code> or
 * <code>KeyGenerator</code>), a <code>KeyFactory</code>, or as a result from
 * an intermediate phase of the key agreement protocol
 * (see <a href = "#doPhase(java.security.Key, boolean)">doPhase</a>).
 * 
 * For each of the correspondents in the key exchange, <code>doPhase</code>
 * needs to be called. For example, if this key exchange is with one other
 * party, <code>doPhase</code> needs to be called once, with the
 * <code>lastPhase</code> flag set to <code>true</code>.
 * If this key exchange is
 * with two other parties, <code>doPhase</code> needs to be called twice,
 * the first time setting the <code>lastPhase</code> flag to
 * <code>false</code>, and the second time setting it to <code>true</code>.
 * There may be any number of parties involved in a key exchange.
